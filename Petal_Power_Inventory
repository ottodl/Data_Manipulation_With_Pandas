# In this challenge I'm a data analyst for a chain of gardening stores called Petal Power. I need to help them analyze their data.

import codecademylib
# First I need to import the libraries that I am going to need 
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# ANSWERING CUSTOMER EMAILS

# Now I need to import the data and save it to inventroy from their inventory.csv
inventory = pd.read_csv('inventory.csv')
# Now I'll take a look at their first 10 rows, which represent the data from Staten Island, and save it to it's own variable
staten_island = inventory.head(10)
#print(staten_island)

# A customer just emailed asking what products are sold at our Staten Island location. 
product_request = staten_island['product_description']
#print(product_request)

# Another customer emailed to ask what types of seeds are sold at the Brooklyn location
seed_request = inventory[(inventory.location == 'Brooklyn') & (inventory.product_type == 'seeds')]
#print(seed_request)

# INVENTORY

# Now I want to check my inventory for each product, so I'll add a column called in_stock and mark True if in stock and False if the quantity is 0
inventory['in_stock'] = inventory.apply(lambda row: 'True' if row.quantity > 0 else 'False', axis=1)
#print(inventory)

# Now we want to see the value of their current inventory or each row
inventory['total_value'] = inventory.quantity * inventory.price
#print(inventory)

# The Marketing Dept wants a complete description of each product for their catalog.
combine_lambda = lambda row: \
    '{} - {}'.format(row.product_type,
                     row.product_description)
inventory['full_description'] = inventory.apply(combine_lambda, axis=1)
#print(inventory)
