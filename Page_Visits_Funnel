#Page Visits Funnel
#Cool T-Shirts Inc. has asked you to analyze data on visits to their website. Your job is to build a funnel, which is a description of how many people continue to the next step of a multi-step process.

#In this case, our funnel is going to describe the following process:

# 1. A user visits CoolTShirts.com
# 2. A user adds a t-shirt to their cart
# 3. A user clicks checkout
# 4. A user actually purchases a t-shirt

import codecademylib
import pandas as pd

visits = pd.read_csv('visits.csv',
                     parse_dates=[1])
cart = pd.read_csv('cart.csv',
                   parse_dates=[1])
checkout = pd.read_csv('checkout.csv',
                       parse_dates=[1])
purchase = pd.read_csv('purchase.csv',
                       parse_dates=[1])

# FUNNEL FOR COOL T-SHIRTS INC.

# First I need to just take a look at these 4 DataFrames to see what I'll be working with
#print(visits)
#print(cart)
#print(checkout)
#print(purchase)

# I'm going to combine vists and cart DataFrames using a left merge.
visits_cart_left_merge = pd.merge(visits, cart, how='left')
#print(visits_cart_left_merge.head())

# Now I want to see how long this DataFrame is and how many of them are Null in the cart_time column
#print(len(visits_cart_left_merge)
#print(len(visits_cart_left_merge[visits_cart_left_merge.cart_time.isnull()]))

# Now I want to calculate the percent of people who visited the website but didn't actually make it to putting anything in their cart.
percent_not_to_cart = float(len(visits_cart_left_merge[visits_cart_left_merge.cart_time.isnull()])) / float(len(visits_cart_left_merge))
#print(percent_not_to_cart)

# Now I want to merge cart and checkout, count the null values, and calculate the percentage of people that put something in their cart but didn't proceed to checkout.

carts_checkout_left_merge = pd.merge(cart, checkout, how='left')
percent_not_to_checkout = float(len(carts_checkout_left_merge[carts_checkout_left_merge.checkout_time.isnull()])) / float(len(carts_checkout_left_merge))
#print(percent_not_to_checkout)

# Now I want to merge checkout and purchase, count the null values, and calculate the percentage of people that proceeded to checkout but didn't actually purchase a T Shirt.
checkout_purchase_left_merge = pd.merge(checkout, purchase, how='left')
#print(checkout_purchase_left_merge)
percent_not_to_purchase = float(len(checkout_purchase_left_merge[checkout_purchase_left_merge.purchase_time.isnull()])) / float(len(checkout_purchase_left_merge))
#print(percent_not_to_purchase)

# Now I want to merge all 4 steps of the funnel, in order, using a series of left merges.

all_data = visits_cart_left_merge.merge(carts_checkout_left_merge, how='left').merge(checkout_purchase_left_merge, how='left')
#print(all_data.head())
#print(len(all_data))

# AVERAGE TIME TO PURCHASE

# Now I want to calculate the average time from intial visit to the final purchase.
# First I'll need to add a column that calculates this.
all_data['time_to_purchase'] = \
    all_data.purchase_time - \
    all_data.visit_time
# Now I can get the average time by using the mean() method on the new time_to_purchase column.
print(all_data.time_to_purchase.mean())
